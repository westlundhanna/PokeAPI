APP SHACK CODE PRACTICE - POKÉ API

This is my first React project. 
The project consists of a paginated and alphabetically sorted list of pokémon cards (9 per page). When a card is clicked the user is navigated to path /pokemonname with more details about that specific pokémon.
Data is fetched from https://pokeapi.co/ with SWR library https://swr.vercel.app/docs/

React features I have used: 
-Components
-React Router
-Hooks
-Destructuring
